# Dark Mode Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a custom dark mode solution using CSS variables and React context. The implementation provides a seamless theme switching experience with proper persistence across sessions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Theme Provider

The theme is managed by a custom `ThemeProvider` component located at `src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`. This provider:

- Manages the current theme state ('light' or 'dark')
- Persists the theme selection in localStorage
- Respects system preference by default
- Toggles between themes with a smooth transition

### 2. CSS Variables

The theme colors are defined using CSS variables in `src/styles/globals.css`:

- Light theme colors are defined in the `:root` selector
- Dark theme colors are defined in the `.dark` selector
- All components use these CSS variables for consistent theming

### 3. Theme Toggle

A `ThemeToggle` component is provided at `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` that:
- Displays a sun icon for light mode and moon icon for dark mode
- Uses the `useTheme` hook to access theme functions
- Provides an accessible toggle button

### 4. Integration

The theme provider is integrated at the root of the application in `src/App.tsx`, ensuring all components have access to the theme context.

## How to Use

### In Components

To use the theme in your components:

```jsx
import { useTheme } from './ThemeProvider';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-background text-foreground">
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### In CSS

To use theme colors in your CSS:

```css
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--background);
  color: var(--foreground);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
}
```

## Testing Dark Mode

To test the dark mode implementation:

1. Click the theme toggle button in the header
2. Verify that the theme changes correctly
3. Refresh the page to ensure the theme persists
4. Check that all components adapt to the new theme

## Verification

The dark mode implementation has been verified to work correctly with:

- ✅ Theme persistence across page refreshes
- ✅ System preference detection
- ✅ Smooth transitions between themes
- ✅ Proper color contrast in both themes
- ✅ Component styling adaptation
- ✅ Accessibility compliance

## Customization

To customize the theme colors:

1. Modify the CSS variables in `src/styles/globals.css`
2. Update both the `:root` (light) and `.dark` (dark) sections
3. Ensure proper color contrast for accessibility
4. Test the changes in both themes
