# Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Google Analytics (optional)
# For development, use G-DEVELOPMENT to disable analytics
# For production, use your actual Google Analytics Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
VITE_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Supabase Configuration (optional - if not provided, app will use localStorage)
# To enable Supabase integration, provide your project URL and anon key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Node Environment
# This is automatically set by the build system
# NODE_ENV=development or NODE_ENV=production

# Development Notes:
# If these variables are not set or are empty, the app will work in fallback mode:
# - Google Analytics will not be loaded
# - CMS will use localStorage instead of Supabase
# - Demo data will be used for content

# Production Notes:
# In production, make sure to set these variables according to your deployment platform:
# - Vercel: Add as Environment Variables in project settings
# - Netlify: Add as Environment Variables in site settings
# - Docker: Pass as environment variables or use env_file in docker-compose.yml

# Environment Variable Priority (highest to lowest):
# 1. System environment variables (export in shell, Docker environment, platform variables)
# 2. .env.local (if exists)
# 3. .env.[mode].local (if exists, where [mode] is development or production)
# 4. .env.[mode] (depends on NODE_ENV)
# 5. .env
# 6. Default values in code
